## Intro
Hey! My name is Hugo (Hugueds if you are close to me) and Welcome to my personal repository.
I'm very proud to choose this area and share my ideas with you.

I was born and raised in Sao Paulo, Brazil

I'm very curious about how the stuff works (such a cliche, don't you think?)

I've been working on a worldwide company which produces Buses and Trucks called Scania AB in the plant of SÃ£o Bernardo do Campo/Brazil.
